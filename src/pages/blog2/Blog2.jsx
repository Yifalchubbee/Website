            The life of an entrepreneur is an enticing prospect for many. If you succeed, you get to choose the work you love, set your own hours and reap the full value of what you sow — plus, you’ll never be forced into doing something you don’t want to just for the sake of not being fired.
            <br />
            <br />
            Having said this, lots of young, aspiring entrepreneurs fail when taking their first steps into the world of business, which holds back many from making that first leap.
            <br />
            <br />
            With this in mind, here are seven tips to maximize your chance of entrepreneurial success.
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Choose a project you’re passionate about.
            <br />
            <br />
            Going into business for yourself isn’t something to be taken lightly. In the beginning, you’ll probably be working a lot harder than you would in a traditional employment position — and you need something more than the prospect of money and the novelty of being a CEO to get you through it.
            <br />
            <br />
            Steve Jobs notably said, “Work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work — and the only way to do great work is to love what you do.”
            <br />
            <br />
            This is why choosing a venture you believe in — and are passionate about — is crucial for every entrepreneur taking their first step into the world of business.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Surround yourself with the right people
            <br />
            <br />
            From the team you assemble to comprise your start-up to the company you keep in your personal life, your success is hugely influenced by the people you surround yourself with.
            <br />
            <br />
            As motivational speaker and entrepreneur Jim Rohn famously claimed, “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”
            <br />
            <br />
            However, we’re influenced by many more people than just these five, so prioritizing networking with experts in your chosen field or industry — and, even better, finding a mentor who has already succeeded in a similar endeavor — is a great way to learn more, stay motivated and improve your chances of success.
            <br />
            <br />
            3. Know your customer inside and out.
            <br />
            <br />
            When you’re first developing your idea as a new entrepreneur, the best thing you can do to set yourself up for success is to know your target demographic inside and out. A common mistake that inexperienced entrepreneurs make is trying to appeal to everyone, with the result being that they often appeal to no one.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, young entrepreneurs should figure out who exactly their product/service/brand is targeting — a.k.a. whose problem the product or service is solving — and research them thoroughly until you know them like the back of your hand. That way, you can appeal directly to them with both your product and marketing strategy.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. Be financially prepared.
            <br />
            <br />
            Often, younger entrepreneurs don’t have the capital saved that older entrepreneurs do as a result of working and saving over many years. However, this doesn’t have to prevent you from succeeding.
            <br />
            <br />
            Of course, saving up before you take the plunge is a great idea — especially having a couple of months' expenses to fall back on — but a third of small businesses in the U.S. begins with a reserve of less than $5,000.
            <br />
            <br />
            The key is to have plans in place to make your money go as far as possible. Keep your overheads as low as you can — don’t bother renting an office space if you can keep operations based remotely/at home in the beginning — and come up with a plan to acquire any extra funding you need.
            <br />
            <br />
            5. Have a vision and set goals.
            <br />
            <br />
            Having an idea is great, but you need to know where you envision your company being in one, five and 10 years, and set your goals accordingly.
            <br />
            <br />
            This way, every single day, you can make sure that what you’re working on is aligned — and getting you closer — to your goals.
            <br />
            <br />
            6. Embark on a lifetime of learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            In order to succeed as a new entrepreneur, you should learn all you can: not just when you start on your entrepreneurial journey, but constantly since your industry will constantly be changing.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to reading and listening to content about your field, products similar to yours and even new marketing strategies, reading case studies about those who’ve come before you — and who’ve succeeded in the area that you want to succeed in — can help you to replicate their success and avoid their mistakes.
            <br />
            <br />
            7. Get started.
            <br />
            <br />
            According to the majority of participants in the Small Business Trends survey — and countless leaders in the entrepreneurship sphere — the best way to learn about entrepreneurship is simply: Start a business.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can do all the reading, preparation and planning in the world, but the only way you’re going to learn how to succeed in entrepreneurship is to take the plunge and begin your entrepreneurial journey.
