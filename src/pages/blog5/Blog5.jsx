          Small businesses can save money and free up internal resources by outsourcing certain business functions. Here are five main functions to consider -- and a few extra ideas you may want to think about.
            <br />
            Ask any small business owner to share their most significant business challenge, and the answer will likely be along the lines of, “I don’t have enough time to [insert a critical business task].”
            <br />
            <br />
            Small business owners are masters at using every spare minute of their time. But they aren't experts at knowing when to shut off their minds, shut down their laptops, or let go of tasks that don’t need their personal touch or could benefit from an expert’s touch.
            <br />
            <br />
            Over and over, business owners get the same advice to tackle their challenges. Experts say the key lies in doing these two things: delegating and outsourcing. They're essentially two ways small business owners can unload tasks from their to-do lists while ensuring they still get done.
            <br />
            <br />
            Delegating is usually the simpler of the two. It’s not too challenging to find someone to take over tasks holding the business owner back. The hesitation occurs when a business owner doesn’t love letting go of certain business aspects. However, most owners will admit they aren't experts in every part of their business.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outsourcing is a bit more complicated. The term has myriad connotations that stem from industry standards, previous experience, and company messaging. While outsourcing is certainly not a bad thing, it's vital to ensure you outsource the right functions for your business to the right people, companies, or organizations. Specifically, consider activities easily outsourced by small businesses and easily handled by others.
            <br />
            <br />
            What small business functions can be outsourced?
            <br />
            <br />
            In short, functions that can -- and should -- be outsourced require a specific skill set that can be found outside the company and are not the primary function of the business.
            <br />
            <br />
            For instance, if your small business offers marketing services, you may not want to outsource your marketing, although you may consider supplementing it. But if you are an accounting firm, outsourcing your marketing functions may prove beneficial and help your business grow.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here are a few examples of outsourced business services to consider.
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Accounting and bookkeeping
            <br />
            <br />
            Accounting is a common function small businesses choose to outsource. If you're not a financial expert, it's tough to become one while running a business. And honestly, do you really want to do your finances? There are processes, compliance standards, tax payments and implications, and numbers to crunch to keep the business running smoothly for any business.
            <br />
            <br />
            There is also a lot of room for costly human error if the person dealing with the business finances rushes through the process, isn’t knowledgeable, or lacks the necessary resources to get the job done. Outsourcing accounting and bookkeeping increases efficiency and will save money in the long term.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Administrative work
            <br />
            <br />
            Often business owners are big thinkers. Therefore, the smaller administrative tasks required to make the big ideas come to life are not the owner’s strength. Outsourcing these functions to a virtual assistant (VA) is a great option, and it is becoming a more common practice. Due to the more recent increase in demand for VAs, enabled by technology and platforms to hire these workers, many have a focused skillset and are great at what they do.
            <br />
            <br />
            VAs will handle anything from scheduling appointments to social media posts. Investing in a virtual assistant can be the best way to keep a business organized and the owner focused.
            <br />
            <br />
            3. Sales
            <br />
            <br />
            Setting up and executing an effective sales process that includes lead generation, sales funnels, and closing deals requires a unique skill set. Sales firms or seasoned professionals are experts at making effective sales calls and closing deals. If your business doesn't have the personnel or expertise to create a sales workflow and close deals, outsourcing this function will put these tasks into the hands of skilled professionals.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. Marketing
            <br />
            <br />
            Word-of-mouth is usually the first approach to marketing a small business. However, the results will slow down at some point, which is the time to focus on marketing for growth. Outsourcing marketing for a small business can include hiring an outside firm. This can be the best way to create and implement a professional, strategic marketing plan. Agencies can manage all aspects -- from concept to design to execution and measurement.
            <br />
            <br />
            These firms are also great for offering an outsider’s perspective and conjuring up new ideas or approaches based on their expertise and knowledge of what works and what doesn’t.
            <br />
            <br />
            5. IT and systems management
            <br />
            <br />
            IT is such a specialized function that it's one of the most outsourced aspects of a business. Since IT and systems management requires a wealth of knowledge, including integration, security, and troubleshooting, most providers will offer a customized approach to assisting your business.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can consider small business IT outsourcing and hand over all of your management to a managed service provider, or you can work with a company with on-demand services that will assist with ongoing maintenance or urgent issues.
            <br />
            <br />
            6. Other services
            <br />
            <br />
            Depending on the type of business and services, other functions are commonly and successfully outsourced. The depth and breadth of what you need will depend on your business, your aspiration to scale, and the availability of internal resources.
            <br />
            <br />
            These functions include:
            <br />
            <br />
            Manufacturing
            Shipping
            Logistics
            Fulfillment
            Customer service
            Human resources            
            <br />
            <br />
            Should you outsource certain functions of your small business?
            <br />
            <br />
            If you're considering outsourcing, then you're likely overwhelmed, stuck, or seeking growth. Outsourcing can create efficiency, cost savings, and free up your time, but you must be ready for the commitment, and you must do it the right way.
